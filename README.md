# To Do
* ~~Stick `/reffiles` and `/queries` in `src/main/resources`~~
* Next - Estimate p-values by creating random query signatures
* Write a `Main` class that
    * ~~loads the reference profiles~~
    * ~~loads an example query Signature~~
    * ~~calculates connectionScores~~
    * Calculate p-values using 10,000 random query signatures on connectivity score
* Write method to do testing on reference sets (groups of profiles) based on file name

* Unit Tests
* Implement in Apache Spark
