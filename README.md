# To Do
* Next - Estimate p-values by creating random query signatures
* Build a File reader that loads:
    1. `ReferenceProfiles`
    1. ~~Query signatures~~
* Write a `Main` class that
    * ~~loads the reference profiles~~
    * loads an example query Signature
    * ~~calculates connectionScores~~
    * Calculate p-values using 10,000 random query signatures on connectivity score
* Unit Tests
* Try and run parallel on local machine and test performance
